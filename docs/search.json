For this, I was interested in looking at counties through the demographic of military veterans. There is a stereotype that veterans tend to vote more conservative, and I wanted to see if that rang true in Washington (though it is a more liberal state, so maybe I should have looked at Tennessee). I looked specifically at the average percentage of people that voted democratic, and found that while it was less than those who voted republican, it is much closer to half of the population. Again, if I tried this again I would look a more conservative state to see if it had the same results.\n\n\n\nExtra credit\n\nUp until now we’ve joined two tables together. But we actually have three tables in this project. How might we join all three together into a single table, so all the measures for each county are combined in one place? (Hint: you can do this is multiple steps, doesn’t have to be one step only.)\n\n\nCode\ninner_join(counties_elexresults, counties_rural_urban_suburban)\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(geoid)`\n\n\n# A tibble: 3,112 × 19\n   geoid total…¹ democ…² repub…³ pct_d…⁴ pct_r…⁵ winne…⁶ margi…⁷ total…⁸ democ…⁹\n   <chr>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 01001   27691    7503   19838    27.1    71.6 R          44.5   24973    5936\n 2 01003  109351   24578   83544    22.5    76.4 R          53.9   95215   18458\n 3 01005   10506    4816    5622    45.8    53.5 R           7.7   10469    4871\n 4 01007    9585    1986    7525    20.7    78.5 R          57.8    8819    1874\n 5 01009   27560    2640   24711     9.6    89.7 R          80.1   25588    2156\n 6 01011    4611    3446    1146    74.7    24.9 D          49.8    4710    3530\n 7 01013    9482    3965    5458    41.8    57.6 R          15.8    8732    3726\n 8 01015   50870   15216   35101    29.9    69   R          39.1   47864   13242\n 9 01017   15259    6365    8753    41.7    57.4 R          15.7   13900    5784\n10 01019   12289    1624   10583    13.2    86.1 R          72.9   10733    1547\n# … with 3,102 more rows, 9 more variables: republican_2016 <dbl>,\n#   winner_2016 <chr>, pct_d_2016 <dbl>, pct_r_2016 <dbl>, margin_2016 <dbl>,\n#   county <chr>, county_name <chr>, state_code <chr>, rural_urban <fct>, and\n#   abbreviated variable names ¹​totalvotes_2020, ²​democrat_2020,\n#   ³​republican_2020, ⁴​pct_d_2020, ⁵​pct_r_2020, ⁶​winner_2020, ⁷​margin_2020,\n#   ⁸​totalvotes_2016, ⁹​democrat_2016\n\n\nCode\ntable1 <- inner_join(counties_elexresults, counties_rural_urban_suburban)\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(geoid)`\n\n\nCode\ninner_join(table1, counties_demographics)\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(geoid, pct_d_2020, pct_r_2020, pct_d_2016,\npct_r_2016, county, county_name, state_code)`\n\n\n# A tibble: 3,112 × 38\n   geoid total…¹ democ…² repub…³ pct_d…⁴ pct_r…⁵ winne…⁶ margi…⁷ total…⁸ democ…⁹\n   <chr>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 01001   27691    7503   19838    27.1    71.6 R          44.5   24973    5936\n 2 01003  109351   24578   83544    22.5    76.4 R          53.9   95215   18458\n 3 01005   10506    4816    5622    45.8    53.5 R           7.7   10469    4871\n 4 01007    9585    1986    7525    20.7    78.5 R          57.8    8819    1874\n 5 01009   27560    2640   24711     9.6    89.7 R          80.1   25588    2156\n 6 01011    4611    3446    1146    74.7    24.9 D          49.8    4710    3530\n 7 01013    9482    3965    5458    41.8    57.6 R          15.8    8732    3726\n 8 01015   50870   15216   35101    29.9    69   R          39.1   47864   13242\n 9 01017   15259    6365    8753    41.7    57.4 R          15.7   13900    5784\n10 01019   12289    1624   10583    13.2    86.1 R          72.9   10733    1547\n# … with 3,102 more rows, 28 more variables: republican_2016 <dbl>,\n#   winner_2016 <chr>, pct_d_2016 <dbl>, pct_r_2016 <dbl>, margin_2016 <dbl>,\n#   county <chr>, county_name <chr>, state_code <chr>, rural_urban <fct>,\n#   state_name <chr>, pct_born_foreign <dbl>, pct_mil_veteran <dbl>,\n#   pct_race_nonwhite <dbl>, pct_ed_college_all <dbl>,\n#   pct_ed_college_white <dbl>, pct_ed_college_white_male <dbl>,\n#   pct_ed_college_white_female <dbl>, …\n\n\nCode\n#I decided to attempt the extra credit, and I think I succeed.

I looked specifically at the average percentage of people that voted democratic, and found that while it was less than those who voted republican, it is much closer to half of the population. Again, if I tried this again I would look a more conservative state to see if it had the same results.\n\n\nExtra credit\n\nUp until now we’ve joined two tables together.
