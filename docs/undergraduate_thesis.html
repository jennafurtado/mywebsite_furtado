<p>As a double major in anthropology and history, I’ve done a lot of writing throughout my undergraduate career. This example comes from the Aztec Empire class I took in the Fall of my senior year. I wrote about the experiences of Aztec women, before and after the conquest of the Aztec empire in order to examine how their roles changed post-conquest. The essay analyzes the work of prominent scholars in the field, and took a gender-focused lens on the conquest of Tenochtitlan. The text of the essay is below:</p>

<p>December 7, 2022</p>
<p>Gender and Conquest: An Analysis of the Experiences of Aztec Women&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Hernando Cortés landed on the coast of modern-day Veracruz, Mexico on April 21, 1519, the Aztecs had the largest empire in the world at the time. Yet, in three years time, that empire was gone. The Spanish conquistadors would not have been able to do this without the help of the indigenous people of the Valley of Mexico, who were either perennial enemies of the Aztecs (like the Tlaxcalans, the main ally of the Spanish) or peoples irritated by the Aztec's tributary system. One of the allies that the Spanish relied on was a Nahua woman named Malinal, known contemporarily as La Malinche. She spoke both Nahua and Chantal Maya, which allowed her to translate the words of tlatoani Moctecuhzoma II to Aguilar (a Spaniard who learned a dialect of Maya after being stranded on Cozumel), who then translated those words into Spanish for Cortes and the others. La Malinche was instrumental in the conquest of the Aztec empire, and is the sole named woman in the conquest of the Aztec empire. This story is not about her though, instead, it follows the countless nameless women living in Tenochtitlan before and after the conquest. By&nbsp; analyzing the differences in aspects of womens' lives in the area around Tenochtitlan pre and post-conquest, this essay will discuss the affect that the Spanish conquest had on women specifically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Production of gender in Aztec society started in childhood, where a variety of rituals would prepare children for their role in society. The three major important phases of childhood in Aztec society were infancy, childhood, and adolescence (De Lucia, 2010, p.&nbsp;609). Each stage was marked by a lifecycle ritual, and some form of body modification which indicated the childs movement towards adulthood (Joyce, 2000, p.&nbsp;476). This production started at birth; during the bathing ritual, children would be given physical objects representative of their gender. For girls, that meant objects like spinning whorls or reed baskets, items which they would use in their adult lives (Joyce, 2000, p.&nbsp;476). The Izcalli ritual, done when the children were at least 4-years-old, was next. During this ritual, children got their ears pierced, and afterwards, adults began introducing children to their future adult tasks. After 7 years old, the children were introduced to proper discipline, an important part of the Aztec methodology of maintaining a balance of opposing energies within their bodies (Joyce, 2000, p.&nbsp;477-8). By 13 or 14, children were fully participatory members of the household and by 15, they took their path into adulthood. Boys went to school for either religion or warfare, while girls got married (De Lucia, 2010, p.&nbsp;610). As demonstrated above, lifecycle rituals throughout childhood taught children their roles in society, defining them as either man or woman. Visual aspects, like hair and clothing, also played into this. For example, girls began wearing skirts at age 4 and wove their hair in the style of adult women (Joyce, 2000, p.&nbsp;479-80). There is not much information about how childhood changed under the Spanish, probably because much of our information about Aztec childhood comes from Spanish chroniclers.</p>
<p>Marriage was the defining part of a girl becoming a woman, though its experiences varied between noblewomen and commoner women. Unfortunately, less is known about the lives of commoner women, simply because the information about women is already limited due to a lack of attention paid to them by the Spanish chroniclers and the chroniclers primarily relied on noble informants. Commoner women, unlike their noble counterparts, were not as restricted in their movement at puberty; they began to attend their section of the telpochcalli (house of youth) then along with learning songs and dances for ritual performances at the House of Song (Clendinnen, 1991, p.&nbsp;156). Marriage, though, was the ultimate goal for young Nahua women of all classes. The parents selected partners for their children, usually to make local alliances between families, and then the process began. Representatives of the young man would bring gifts to the house of young woman, where she would then go through ritual denigration by her family members while wearing her best clothes. After this, the parents would accept, and the young women would be carried off by the older kinswomen of the future husband to the house of his people. The pair then spent 4 days together, where they were expected to not participate in sexual intercourse, but instead get to know each other as both were inexperienced and probably had not much interaction with the other gender (Clendinnen, 1991, p.&nbsp;160-1). Marriage in Aztec society did not symbolize submission to the husband, rather it was a transfer of care between the husband's mother and his new wife. While the process of marriage was similar for noblewomen, it was more dependent on political alliances and they were much more secluded than commoner women were before marriage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heritage was an incredibly important part of the Aztec political system, so noblewomen who could claim to be part of specific bloodlines (like the Toltecs) often married for political alliances. Political marriages were particularly common amongst ruling families, as they denoted hierarchy and made alliances between powerful city-states. For example, scholar Lori Boornazian Diel, detailed a phenomenon called interdynastic hypogamy. She explained that, among Nahua elites, the more powerful ruler would offer his daughter in marriage to the less powerful ruler. "This daughter then became the principal wife of the subordinate ruler and the mother of the heir to the throne. This system allied the two cities while publicly communicating the hierarchical ranking of the two." (Diel, 2007, 279) Thus for noblewomen, marriage was a way to support their families and the creation of empire. One specific distinction between marital life of nobles and commoners was the view on concubines. Commoners viewed keeping concubines as scandalous, while among noble (particularly royal) households, concubines were useful for their skill in embroidery or cooking. Scholar Susan Toby Evans even noted that if a ruler acquired a concubine for their sexual ability, they may give birth to a future heir (Evans, 1998, p.&nbsp;172).&nbsp; The view on concubines emphasized differences between classes, and their distinct priorities. Concubines in the palace operated in a servile role, made clear by the fact that many of them were probably purchased as slaves. Marriage after the conquest, though, was much more connected to Christianity and the Spanish attempts to convert the indigenous peoples in the Valley of Mexico.</p>
<p>After the conquest, one of the ways that things changed was the imposition of Christianity, and part of that was the change in views on marriage. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the Aztecs relied on the ideal of moderation to discipline their daily lives. Essentially, in order to maintain balance between the forces of tonalli and tlazolli. Tonalli was positive, something all Aztecs were born with that could be lost if they leaned too far into activities which favored tlazolli, the "negative" energy (Burkhart, 1989, p.&nbsp;132-3). Thus, maintaining one's self was maintaining a balance between these two opposing energies; something that the Spanish ignored for abstinence. Marriage was necessary if one wanted to live a sin-free life, yet married couples shouldn't partake sexual intercourse unless they aimed to produce children, and if they did so, they should not find pleasure in the act of sex (Burkhart, 1989 p.&nbsp;152-3). Rather than moderation, Spanish friars insisted on the practice of celibacy unless absolutely necessary. Furthermore, the Spanish considered a marriage "damaged" if: "one married a close relative…or if one did not confess before marriage." (Burkhart, 1989, p.&nbsp;156) Anthropologist Louise Burkhart explained though the ideology of moderation was more suited to the European ideals of marriage and sexuality, the Spanish regarded sexuality as filthy and therefore preferred abstinence over moderation (Burkhart, 1989, p.&nbsp;159). Sexuality itself was regulated by the friars, punishing harshly deviances that were at least tacitly accepted by the Aztecs.</p>
<p>Gender, and in turn sexuality, was much more nuanced and fluid before the arrival of the Spanish, exemplified by evidence of homosexuality and fluidity portrayed with gods of the Aztec cosmology. For instance, as scholar Miranda Stockett points out, there were gods with both male and female aspects, emphasizing the duality of Aztec cosmology, as well as artwork of female rulers and warriors (Stockett, 2005, p.&nbsp;568). Furthermore, as discussed above, sex and pleasure was tied to the idea of balance and moderation. Young people especially were expected to remain chaste, as it could lead to impotence in men and insatiable desire in women; once married though, they could engage in sex within reason (Evans, 1998, p.&nbsp;273). Homosexuality, rather than being disliked for being a 'sin,' was more a question of deception. Cuiloni, the Nahuatl word for homosexual, were described as men who speak like women and therefore, pretend to be women. Patlache, a Nahuatl word translated to intersexual, refers to a person who 'speaks like a man' and 'goes about like a man.' (Sousa, 2019, p.&nbsp;187) When the Spanish translated these words, they often lost their nuance, reflecting the negative view the Spanish held of homosexuality. Cuiloni became "the sodomite" and Patlache became "the woman who has two sexes" (Sousa, 2019, p.&nbsp;186). Thus, under the Spanish, gender and sexuality was more restricted, tied deeply to ideas about Christianity rather than duality. One aspect of life that remained important for women after the conquest was their role in trade and weaving.</p>
<p>Weaving, especially in its relation to trade and Aztec tradition, allowed women to have control over their lives and be an integral part of the family. Both men and women could be craft specialists, though textile production was usually regarded as the domain of women specifically. Cloth, as author Julia Hendon pointed out, was not just used for practical purposes but also played an important role in the celebrations of births, weddings, funerals, and other important events (Hendon, 2006, p.&nbsp;355). Moreover, textile production knowledge was passed down through the generations, mediated through women, and required a vast knowledge of current technologies and design. The backstrap loom, the primary form of technology used for weaving, had to supported by the weavers own body, allowing the weaver to direct tension of the string with small movements of their body (Hendon, 2006, p.&nbsp;362). The loom, though mostly phased out, is still used today by some master weavers in Mesoamerica, showing the level of skill it takes to use and also the quality of product that comes from it. Another aspect of textile production was social class; commoner women wove to fulfill tribute requests from Tenochtitlan and to support their families, while noble women (especially priestesses and secondary wives) wove as part of their duties (Hendon, 2006, p.&nbsp;365). As discussed above, polygyny was practiced more in noble households, especially the palace, as a way of forming political alliances and demonstrating power. The role of concubines in weaving is another complex dimension of textile production in the Pre-Hispanic empire.</p>
<p>Concubines, largely found in palaces in the empire, were not just used for their sexual services, but also their skills in weaving and cooking. The king's wives had their own suite of rooms within the palace, which varied and size and quality, most likely distributed to women based on their rank and role (primary or secondary wife) (Evans, 1998, p.&nbsp;177). The Spanish, who did not approve of polygyny due to the religion, made monogamy the only legal way to be married after the conquest ended in 1521. While this change did not stop cloth production among Aztec women, and some of them began to use European products and methods along with traditional methods of weaving, wealth began to be associated with land, rather than textiles (Evans, 2008, p.&nbsp;216). Indigenous men who resisted this and kept their traditional practices would be met with hostility or subtle pressure via Catholic friars staying in the homes of noblemen to suppress polygyny, even sometimes facing death by torture. Despite their harsh view on polygyny, indigenous people of the Valley observed Spanish hypocrisy, in the fact that many of the men who had wives back in Spain would still engage in extramarital relations (Evans, 2008, p.&nbsp;227). Furthermore, the Spanish brought with them a new view on gender relations – women should be obedient, and stay in the home. This undercut any ability Aztec women had to be economically independent, and led them to be more dependent on their husbands (Evans, 2008, p.&nbsp;228-230). Before the Spanish arrived, women held a prominent role in tribute cloth production and in selling their items at markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though both men and women could be textile craft specialists, tribute cloth production was largely a role that women took on. Elizabeth M. Brumfiel was a prominent scholar in the analysis of Aztec women and textile production, and her work informed much of the current interpretations about the topic today. She argued that tribute cloth was an imperative part of the tributary system, being that all but two of the tributary provinces provided some sort of cloth to Tenochtitlan and that between 147,000 and 428,000 items of cloth were delivered annually to Tenochtitlan (Brumfiel, 1997, p.&nbsp;57). Much of the pressure to produce this enormous amount of cloth fell onto Aztec women. Though the number may have been large, textile production was meaningful for women and allowed them to express their reproductive power. Spindle whorls, the technology that determines the thickness and quality of string that can be spun, became more durable and highly decorated throughout the middle and Late Postclassic (Brumfiel, 1997, p.&nbsp;64). This demonstrates that women maintained a high quality of cloth production, in order to call attention to their power as bearers of children and makers of cloth. Thus, as Brumfiel argued, the fact that the quality of cloth sent out for the tribute (demonstrated by spindle whorls found at postclassic Aztec archaeological sites) was still high meant that the status of women was connected to their status as weavers (Brumfiel, 1997, p.&nbsp;65). Cloth quality, though, could also be used as a form of resistance against exploitation, displayed in the ways that Aztec women responded to tribute demands under Spanish rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Women, as Brumfiel argues, know when they are being exploited, and yet had to maintain the high quality of cloth they sent in for tribute to the intense monitoring system put in place. Spindle whorls, as mentioned above, were tied to the tightness of thread being spun (thicker for maguey due to its coarse texture, for example), and thus the increase in thicker spindle whorls could demonstrate a decline in cloth quality (Brumfiel, 1996, p.&nbsp;455). Brumfiel's research demonstrated though, that there was no empirical evidence of this increase. She resisted the idea that this meant that Aztec women simply accepted their exploitation, and instead offers a possible different explanation for the lack of this phenomenon. Perhaps, because of the intensive monitoring on tribute items and possibility of coercion or punishment if quality was not good enough, women had no choice but to provide high quality product (Brumfiel, 1996, p.&nbsp;458-9). The Spanish empires conquest did not just affect tribute production, but also the trade of items like cooking pots. A study done by authors Enrique Rodriguez-Alegria and Wesley Stoner found that in Xaltocan (one of the tributary provinces of Aztecs), the people resumed production of Plain Ware serving vessels where they once got them from nearby province Cuauhtitlan and saw the introduction of glazed-earthenware from Otumba after the Spanish conquest. From that, they argued after the collapse of the Aztec tributary system due to the conquest, the community began to increase locally made serving vessels again instead of receiving them elsewhere (Rodriguez-Alegria and Stoner, 2016, p.&nbsp;205). Thus, unlike the spindlewhorls, the imposition of a new tribute system under the Spanish allowed for an increase of local products in places like Xaltocan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with a change in the tributary system, Aztec women also lost access to the political system because of Spanish ideals tied to Christianity and European ideas of ideal womenhood. While unusual, there were a few women rulers in Aztec history. Furthermore the roles of tlatocacihuatl and cihuateculti were named adminsterial roles sometimes held by women (Kellogg, 1995, p.&nbsp;565). More likely though, women held powerful positions in the marketplace. They were both buyers and vendors, along with administrators (tianquizpan tlayacanqui). The marketplace administrative role, also held by men, saw them overseeing fair prices, supervising production of war provisions, and assigning tribute. Women could also hold hierarchal, official roles with guilds focused on craft production, though it is unknown whether there were parallel women's guilds or women's divisions within these guilds (Kellogg, 1995, p.&nbsp;566). Thus, before the arrival of the Spanish, women could hold and did hold several different positions of power within the marketplace. Women also at times did hold important political positions in secondary communities, as demonstrated by historian and anthropologist Lori Boornazian Diel. Looking at a pictorial history created for the small town of Tepechpan, known as the Tira de Tepechpan, Diel explored the roles of the founding queen, Toltec ennobler, marriage alliance facilitator, and regent (Diel, 2005, p.&nbsp;83).</p>
<p>Women didn't just appear in the Tira de Tepechpan though, they were also in the pictorial histories of other secondary communities and even found amongst the histories of Texcoco, one of the partners in the Triple Alliance that founded the Aztec empire. The Codex en Cruz is the only other pictorial representation of a preconquest female ruler, showing a woman named Azcaxochitl ascending the throne after her husband Cocopin of Tepetlaotzoc died. Identified as a daughter of Nezahualcoyotl, the famed strategist and one of the founders of the Triple Alliance, the codex indicated that she ruled until her death when her grandson took over the throne. Another codex, the Codex Kingsborough, mentioned her but did not picture, possibly suggesting that some female rulers may have been deliberately left out (Diel, 2005, p.&nbsp;92-3). Though female rulers were rare, they may have occurred more than we know about. Many of the pictorial histories archaeologists use to analyze the lives of women and of Aztec people in general were written and drawn after the conquest, done by Spanish friars who had much more negative view of women due to their religion and misogyny present at the time. Diel also pointed out that three codexes about Texcoco (Codox Xolotl, Mapas Tlotzin, and Quinatzin) all featured women in roles of authority in pre-imperial Texcoco, but the depiction of women faded away once Texcoco received imperial status. This was because, as she argues, the women could no longer provide a connection to a higher authority, and therefore were excluded (Diel, 2005, p.&nbsp;95). The exclusion of women is not surprising, as it was part of the new morality and religion imposed on the Aztecs by the Spanish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christianity was a major playor in the transfer of womens role from being able to operate outside of the domestic sphere to being wholly constricted to it. As scholar Louise Burkhart noted in her book The Slippery Earth, young Aztec women were taught to not stay out and about, rather they should hurry home and not smile as they passed by other people. In other words, they were like ghosts, not to be perceived (Burkhart, 1989, p.&nbsp;137). Before, young women would follow their mothers to the market to learn the tricks of the trade they would master and dance alongside young men in certain ceremonies. While they were not 'equal' to young men in the Western sense of the world, they had much more freedom within their roles than they did underneath the rule of the Spanish. Moreover, Sahagun criticized noblewomen for wearing elaborate, decorated clothes, comparing them to Saint Clare, who purposefully wore rags and itchy clothing to show her humility (Burkhart, 1989, p.&nbsp;139). Noblewomen, whose heritage allowed them to wear cotton clothing (commoners only could wear clothing made out of maguey), were criticized for their choice to wear decorative clothes. The friars also believed that the women should not paint their faces, nor wear their hair in intricate designs; instead, they should avert their eyes and look as plain as possible (Burkhart, 1989, p.&nbsp;139). The extreme ideals of humility and modesty contradicted the ideals of moderation discussed earlier, which had no problem with painted faces or decorated clothing amongst noblewomen. Furthermore, the emphasis on virginity even when they promoted the birth of many children, illustrated a strict ideal of purity unfamiliar to the Aztecs. Under the Spanish, women suffered, their ability to express themselves and their power within the boundaries of their roles shrinking.</p>
<p>Before the conquest, though Aztec women did not hold as much power as Aztec men, they had important roles in the economic system and at times, even held roles within the political system. After the conquest, Aztec women's roles were restricted to being good Christian women–staying at home, bearing children, and leaving the work outside of the domestic sphere to the men. Although not discussed in the paper, many women also suffered during the conquest at the hands of the Spanish. The Spanish soldiers were cruel, raping and murdering women and children, and then going on to assert their values as more 'civilized' than that of the indigenous peoples living under the Aztec empire. Furthermore, much of our information about women living in the prehispanic Aztec empire is unfortunately mediated through the view of the Spanish chroniclers, who had an impetus to erase the roles of prominent women or disregard them if it didn't fit their ideology. As archaeology continues to uncover more things about the Aztec empire, hopefully more attention will be paid to the women of the Aztec empire outside of Malinal, a women both demeaned and revered amongst Mexicans. Though, it is also important to not let Western biases about what is equality and what is oppression leak into our analysis of the lives of prehispanic Aztec women. Women of both the past and present will continue to exist and tell their stories, whether that be through words of the objects they leave behind.</p>
